                    Over the persiod of two weeks, a team of 5 students built an immersive VR underwater experience which was exhibited during the final expostion.

                <h3>Shark Tank</h3>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    Shark Tank offers a thrilling VR experience in which users experience the underwater world. It offers an immersive experience that extends to the real world. Users get to interact with sharks which is an exciting experience. While this game is meant for fun, simliar games can be developed by specialist to help people overcome their phobias through exposure therapy.

                <h4>How It Works</h4>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    Shark Tank is a Unity-built VR experience. The user is given instructions and given the Oculus controllers. The steps into the physical cage and puts on the headset. The experience is already booted so the user can interact immediately with the underwater environment. When the user sticks their hand out of the cage, the Shark detects it and approaches the user, thus creating a thrilling experience. When the user pulls back their hand, the shark swims away. To increase immersion, the physical cage is shaken to simulate the underwater feeling and the shark hitting the cage adding an extra layer of reality to it.

                <br/>
                <p>
                    The process was frustrating at the beginning since all the attempts to get a Unity build uploaded to the Oculus failed at first assuming us to waste valuable time (more than a week) on resolving the issue rather than perfecting our final product. Nonetheless, we managed to deliver a functional product for the exposition. It was quite surprising to witness the reactions form the visitors, fellow students, and teachers. There were those who screamed out of fear, those who giggled from joy, and those who were so immersed in the experience that they almost tripped the cage while trying to reach forward for the sharks. We had long rows of people wanting to try out the experience, but unfortunately, we had to decline some of the request or ask them to come later because the Oculus battery could not keep up being powered for the duration of the exposition which result in us charging it for a bit to allow one or two visitors to try the game and then charge it again. However, seeing people return multiple times and some even playing the game twice was quite an indicator of how successful our game and setup were. Even though I was quite displeased with the final product, I was quite impressed after seeing the reactions of the visitors.</p>

                <p>
                The quality of our final product could have been better, if we did not loss that much time trying to figure out the Oculus connection. Still, we reverted to an older version of our product that is less realistic as the version with fog and water shader ran on the laptop, but not the Oculus. Additionally, the position and the movement of some of the fish were unrealistic and some even static, but due to the time constrains, we were unable to fix that.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    The atmosphere in the group was quite turbulent as some of the team members kept getting into conflicts. This was fueled further by the frustration of the Oculus not connecting. However, regardless of the unstable group dynamics, the group managed to cooperate in creating the finale product. My role in the team was mainly technical in which my main focus was on the Oculus and Unity. During this project I learned how to set up Unity and Oculus, how to connect them and cast from one device to the other, how to build a scene using unity assets and shaders, how to build an underwater seen and how to create a full VR experience. While there is still a lot for me to learn about Unity, I would not mind working on Unity or VR related projects in the future.

                    I personally had a hard time working in such noisy and corded environment. It was harder for me to think clearly and at times, it would have been more efficient to work from somewhere quite in school where I could focus better. However, I was quite impressed to see how we managed to deliver a functional product in the span of two weeks. Seeing ones effort materialize is quite nice and the fact that a product that was far from perfect could elicit such a reaction from the users made me rethink my perfectionistic tendencies. It also made me wonder, if such an imperfect product made by amutures in the field of VR and who are new to Unity can have such an effect, then what are the possibilities out there? Overall, The Lab Weeks was quite a nice experience, and it was nice to see what other teams came up with and test their products.
