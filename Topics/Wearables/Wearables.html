                <h3>Reimagine The phone without A Regular Interface </h3>
                <br/>
                <p class="blogtext">
                    The new phone takes the form of a digital wristband. Users interact with the phone through a hologram interface to interact with it. People can use this new phone to execute tasks like that of a regular phone. They can view information, select objects, and make calls. To view information, multiple beamers are used to construct an hologramlike screen. The new phone is powered by motion sensors that detect where the user moves their hand in the space in relation to the projected screen to detect selection of an object. Gestures using computer vision and voice commands using microphones can be also face as input to interact with the phone. This phone can be connected to wireless headphones for conducting calls and listening to music. For instance, if a user wants to make a call, if the person is listed in their favorite, they can initiate a specific gesture for calling that person. If not, the user can activate the hologram screen by waving their hand twice back and forth. Once the screen appears, they can move their hands to where the call icon and hover over it for 5 seconds. This shows a list of saved people, the user can then select the person they want to call. If the number they want to call is not saved in their list, they can use a similar hovering method to type in the number if they are in a place where they cannot talk, otherwise they can say the numbers out loud and give a voice command to initiate the call. The wristband has a size and is made of material similar to that of current smartwatches and the color might vary depending on the preference of the user.

                    <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2017/living-sensors-your-fingertips-0215"><i>Hydrogel</i></a> acts as a nourishing environment in which types of bacteria and live cells can thrive and are programmed to light up when encountering certain chemicals. This detection capability does not only limit itself to the external environment but extends to the inside of the human body. As such wearable gloves powered by the sensors that use the biomaterial has been developed. Such gloves can be used in chemical factories, labs, crime scene and other potentially contaminated locations. However, since the gloves are based on biomaterial, certain requirements regarding the humidity, nutrients and oxygen must be met for the gloves to maintain their functionality. By addressing this and other issues, the team developing these gloves constructed a model for others to use who might be interested in designing devices based on living biomaterials.

                    The topic is quite interesting especially with the rise of 3D-printing. This provides endless possibilities for "normal" users to create and invent their own wearables and other objects whether these are powered by technology or not. This is especially true as the range of material that can be used for printing is expanded beyond that of polymer. While such wide accessibility to 3D printing can be disrupting to the current supply chain, it can be freeing to the consumers as they are able to customize their own products and use their inventive minds to create something new, from clothes and home appliances to art and smart devices. The market of wearables in growing and it will undoubtedly continue to do so as prices go down. Consequently, wearables will become widely used in sports, fashion, health and security providing their users with a more efficient life.
