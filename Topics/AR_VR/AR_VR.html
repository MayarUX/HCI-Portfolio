                    The advancement of technology has allowed the creation of virtual environments powered by computers. These virtual environments are not only incubated within a hardware device, but also have an extension to the real world forming a reality-virtuality spectrum. This spectrum extends from the real environment on the one end to the virtual one on the other hand in what is called a <i>Mixed Reality (MR)</i>. Several technologies that are used to create these MRs which is way the industry adopted the term <i>XR</i> with the letter ‘X’ referring to how virtual environment is perceived in relation to reality and the type of technology used to either build or interact with such an environment. The most popular and commercially available XRs are <i>Virtual Reality (VR)</i> and <i>Augmented Reality (AR)</i>.</p>  
                <br/>
                <p>VR is an immersive virtual environment in which the users are presented with simulations that allow them to leave the real world to enter a new one as if they were present in there. For users to interact with such environment VR headsets are often used. On the other hand, AR brings the digital environment out to the real world with which the user can interact with. AR can take on several forms such as hologram or an extra layer on top of reality. The most popular way is which users can interact with AR objects is using a smartphone or a tablet. As VR and AR technologies are becoming more affordable, many fields are starting to utilize them to help achieve their goals. These fields include, but are not limited to, healthcare, healthy lifestyle, and the environment. </p>

                    VR has been increasingly used within the field of mental health. For instance, VR is used for exposure therapy to treat people with phobias. With advancement in <i>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</i> and machine learning, using virtual therapist might be used for people with light mental health issues to decrease the pressure the sector is under now due to shortage of staff. Virtual therapists have a human like avatar and use voice and image recognition to analyze their patients’ emotions and reaction during a two-way communication therapy session. As VR and AI technologies become more advanced virtual therapist can be used for more complex problems while providing a unique and tailored therapy sessions based on the machine collected and analyzed data.

                    VR can be used to stimulate a healthy lifestyle. In VR, users create an avatar of themselves with which they can interact with in the VR. During these interactions users are asked to choose between healthy and unhealthy habits and food options. In so doing, the avatar appearance reacts to what their choices. This simulation visualizes the consequences of their choices by holding a virtual mirror. Seeing oneself in an undesirable state might trigger fear which can lead to healthy behavioral change. For instance, if a user wants to know whether they are currently following a healthy diet, they can feed their avatar what their diet and observe the new state their avatar enters as well as receive a report that, in addition to the data, has tips on how they can change their diet. This can be used to help combat obesity.

                    While a lot of people know about climate change, many of them find it hard to engage in sustainable behavior. One reason for that is that climate change is impacting Earth gradually resulting in major disturbances to the planet, the environment and its inhabitants that are irreversible. This gradual change makes the topic far removed from people, especially for those who are not affected greatly by climate change in the present. Using VR, users can travel to an alternate world in the future where the consequences of climate change are visible. By making climate change tangible people are more likely to engage in sustainable behavior with the aim to preserve the environment.

                    <a href="https://refikanadol.com/works/machine-memoirs-space/?i=m"><i>Machine Memoirs: Space Exhibition </i></a> is an exhibition displaying various artworks. All artworks are digital simulation of data that take a variety of forms from 2D LED display artworks to 3D and multidimensional artworks and from data sculptors to immersive artworks. In creating these artworks, space data collected by NASA telescopes over the past 60 years has been used to bring the outer space to Earth in the form of data-driven artworks using machine learning based on trained fluid dynamics algorithms. The exhibition explores the aesthetic possibilities resulting from combining data on and, the memory, knowledge, and history of our cosmos.

                    It is impressive to see how this project makes use of data to create aesthetically pleasing artworks. The immersive layer added to some of these artworks add an additional layer of fascination by removing the distance boundary between us humans and the outer space. Such artworks take allow one to have an emulated experience similar to what telescopes in outer space in their journey to uncover the mysteries of our universe.

                    The topic of AR/VR has always fascinated me through its power to combine two worlds into one; and through offering alternate worlds inspired by the imagination and creative potential of the creators of these worlds. Even though, the first attempts to create virtual environments can be traced back to the previous century, the field is still young. Nonetheless, it will not be long until XR technologies become widely adopted in various fields—beyond that of entertainment—as prices go down and more people enter the field of developing these technologies and the corresponding applications that can be utilized by these technologies. When paired with AI and machine learning, XR technologies become powerful tool that assist humans in their personal and professional lives as the possibilities of these technologies are only bound by the technical constrains and the imagination of their creators. This course allowed me to tap into the subject and learn more about it and learn how to build applications that are suited for AR and VR applications.
