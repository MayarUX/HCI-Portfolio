                    <i>Artificial creatures</i> are non-biological creatures made by humans. These creatures often simulate other living beings and are given qualities to ensure an optimal simulation within the bounds of current technological advancements. These creatures are often referred are often referred to as robots and are often powered by artificial intelligence (AI). AI powered robots have an enhanced performance as they can learn to make better decisions. Since artificial creatures have anthropomorphic or animal like features, they often engage in affective computing in which emotions, mood, and effect of those they interact are considered. Artificial creatures can perceive affect through behavioral and/or physiological measures, or by directly asking the users. As technology becomes more advances, artificial creatures are becoming more human like. While this might be desirable to increase familiarity and provide a better user experience, being too human like might trigger an uncanny valley effect in which artificial creatures induce a sense of eeriness in their users. Therefore, a balance must be maintained, and a line must be drawn between artificial and real. </p>

                <h3>The Homeostasis of An Automatic Sliding Door</h3>
                <br/>
                <p class="blogtext">
                    An automatic sliding door can be found in almost all public buildings now a days. These doors use infrared sensors to detect motion. Once detected, the doors open for a short amount of time after which they automatically close again. Thus, it can be said that the homeostasis of these doors is to remain closed. Even when there is an obstacle that prevents the doors from closing, the doors will try to regain their original state by trying to close. This can be notice on several occasions, for instance when many people are entering a building in a row and the door tries to close after the opening duration has elapsed even though the row of people has not ended yet. This can lead the doors to feel frustrated and angry at the humans entering the building. A more extreme example can be observed when someone applies pressure on one of the doors or when both doors are held by a heavy object. In these cases, a sound of the doors trying to close can be heard. If the doors stay in such an "unnatural" state for too long, the system is overloaded which might lead to malfunction eventually. In this case, the doors end in a state of burnout and exhaustion as a result of this stressful situations.

                    <a href="https://www.robokind.com/advanced-social-robots"><i>Milo</i></a> is an assistive robot that helps children on the autism spectrum learn social skills. It slow speaking voice and simple language that make him understandable for the children allowing them to process the auditory information more effectively. Furthermore, Milo has his own facial expressions that are displayed when interacting with him or during training sessions. In addition to that, Milo has a screen on his chest that provide additional visual assistance to help children increasing its accessibility. Milo provides social skills training and relies on repetition.

                <p>
                    At the moment, artificial creatures are limited in their adoption and their applications. However, new advances are being made in the technology and on a societal level that enhance their performance and increase their acceptability with society. The mention of the use of robots in the job market, for instance, is often paired with an angsty voice that threatens job loss. However, when looking at the current job market, there is a shortage of hands in many professions that can use such robots to improve their performance by taking on mundane, repetitive or dangerous jobs. It is no doubt that more artificial creatures are going to wave themselves into our lives, and for that we should step ahead and ensure their safe and secure usage for and by our society to avoid that stepping in too late when this technology is misused by those who hold the power over them.
