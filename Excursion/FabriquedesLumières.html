                    Both exhibitions allow visitors to have an immersive experience in which enter the artworks and taking them on a journey within the world of the artists. A full dynamic exprience is created by using a variety of visual elements such as shapes, colors, size, position, contrast and lighting, in addition to movement, animations and music. Furthermore, the production itself and the selcetion of the order of the artworks follows a narrtive, for instance, by telling the life story of the artist.

                <h3>Contemporary Art</h3>

                <br/>
                <p class="blogtext">
                    The two contemporary art works are <a href="https://www.fabrique-lumieres.com/en/journey"><i>Journey</i></a> and <a href="https://www.fabrique-lumieres.com/en/memories"><i>Memories</i></a>. These are held in a smaller room with projection on the four walls and a floor covered by mirrors to create a full immersive experience in which the user feels as if they have transferred into the artwork. The upward motion of the artworks gives the user a sense of going down wards. This and other illusory perception experiences can be experienced while watching these artworks.

                <h3>The Light Stripes (Technological Selection)</h3>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    The Light Stripes is an interactive space that can be found in the main hall. Visitors can interact with the artworks of Klimt and Hundertwasser in a playful way. As the visitors approach the dark walls, parts of the artwork get lit up and revealed as the visitors walk alongside the interactive wall. This allows for a playful interaction with the wall, in which people dance to the music to see parts of the artwork revealed and others racing from one side of the wall to the other in the hope of seeing the artwork as a whole before it disappears once again under the curtains of the darkness.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    The Instalation makes use of several technologies. First, projection mapping is used to display the art work on the walls. Second, the projected artwork is covered by a dark layer that is divided into columns or stirps. Third, motion and proximity sensors are used to reveal and light up parts of the artwork as visitors approach the wall.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    This installation provides teh visores with a playful way to interact with the artworks of famous artits. It tiggers a sense of cruirity to uncover the hidden artwork making them more willing to engae with and learn about.

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    The different exhibitions create a memorable immersive experience in which one can transfer themselves into the world of classical and contemporary artwork. The movement and positioning of the different elements of the screen add extra dimensionality and depth to the artworks and thus enriching the experience. Shapes and colors morph and melt together allowing a smooth transition between the various artworks that are displayed in accordance to a clear narrative. What is also fascinating is that the viewing location and the body position (sitting, standing, or laying down) allows the viewer to have a different experience of the displayed artworks. 
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    While immersive, the exhibition lacked interactivity as visitors could only interact with the artworks in Light Strips. This was quite disappointing as the atmosphere with the displayed art and the music invite the user to interact with that art amidst the immersive experience. Another notable thing was that in the main hall with the big two exhibitions, some locations where better for viewing the displayed artworks in their totality than others, especially since there were times when different walls showed different artworks making it harder for visitors to follow. 
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    Nonetheless, it was a mesmerizing experience. The mission of CuluralSpaces of bringing art to a wider audience is on its way and by digitalizing it and making viewing art and immersive experience younger generations are more likely to visit museum and similar exhibitions by enhancing the user experience and for the younger generations to learn more about art and its history and learn more about the old masters.
