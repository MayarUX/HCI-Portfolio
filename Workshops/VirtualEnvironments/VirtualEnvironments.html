                    <i>Virtual Environments</i> are computer simulated environments. These environments can emulate that of the real world or fictional. Objects in these environments are often multidimensional and can be either realistic or animated. These environments can run on different devices providing a virtual or augmented reality experience and which has the capacity to become immersive taking the user to another world. These environments can be built using a variety of tools such as Unity or A-Frame and can run on different devices such as computers (i.e., standalone, browsers), smart devices (i.e., smartphones, tablets) and VR headsets. Additionally, the applications might either run online or offline.

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <br/>
                <p>It was quite interesting to experiment with building games in Unity and build VR environments using A-Frame. The power of customization using Mods in Unity, was what caught my attention the most as by making few tweaks, a more interesting game can be built. These tweaks can be used to create game levels. Furthermore, when making bigger tweaks using other Unity assets or newly created assets, one can customize the game so much that it becomes a new game. On the other hand, A-Frame allows people, especially developers to create web-based VR experiences using familiar tools such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As such, VR experiences become more accessible to the users as they do not to download the experience on their computers which is effective as disk space is saved. It also increases the VRs applications portability as the experience can be opened on almost any supported browser. This resolves a lot of compatibility issues that might be experienced with Unity applications. However, since A-Frame run in real-time, and are often hosted on servers to reach a wider audience online, the experience might be a bit slower and jittery and might be disrupted when the Internet connection is lost. Regardless, both methods have their advantages and disadvantages and depending on the purpose of the VR application and the context of the experience, one tool might be preferable over the other. </p>
