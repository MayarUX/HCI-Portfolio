                    It is interesting to explore the topic of Arduino and to gain basic practical experience. By learning a bit about it, it might be interesting to see how arduino can be used to automate things at home or to to create basic security devices, for instance by using the proximity sensor. Arduino can also serve as a tool for children to enagage and learn more about technology as it allows them to learn and and directly observe the results using a pyhsical device. In general, arduino provides a simple and easy way for those who are less technical to produce technical creations.
